# ChatsUpp

ChatsUpp is a Bidirectional app that allows communication of multiple users simultaneously, developed with React, NodeJS/Express and Socket.IO

It is a simple application but shows the power of a one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.

When you join the website type your name and press your keyboard enter. You are all set to start sending messages and receiving from different users.

Note: I will add a submit button as a few mobile users had complained that is not so clear how to submit, it is "return" button on your mobile keyboard.
